# About

To get more experience and familiar with front-end website design, I'm trying to recreate Youtube's layout in html and all that good stuff. I might add a Flask server down the line to get searchbars working if I ever finish this project.

Oh yeah and also, I feel like if I can make a website with a reference, I'll probably be able to make a sketch of a website and then create it in the future which would be cool to be able to do. Like, maybe I could do Fiverr as a hobby or something just to build a portfolio.

#To Do

-   Change the text so it isn't using the :before pseudo element to display text. This is bad since I wont be able to change the text in the future.
-   Create "Search" text in searchbar in navbar
-   Do the backend, duh. Actually, maybe I wont do backend for this.
